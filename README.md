# NitiAI-Frontend-Challenge

Built a Netflix carousel component that pops up on hover. The webpage supports pagination with arrow keys on either side to scroll left or right. Designed the backend API to fetch images using data.json file that contains all the urls of the images used. The dot indicator below the carousel can also be used to navigate to the specified page. The webpage is completely responsive and configurable for every screen size.
